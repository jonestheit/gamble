Rolling dice to make a fortune - NOT

This idea started in 1987 when I started to analyse horse racing and discovered I didn't like the risk of losing. I guess if I'd persisted it might have been easy to select bets that would have been at good odds, but then I would have had problems keeping an account with bookmakers, who don't like winners. All too much hassle, and I don't value money above sunshine and sufficient beer.

Feel free to play with and extend this simple illustration. 

Always bear in mind that gambling is a problem for everyone unless they have a proper grasp of simple statistics. Betting against organisations that exist to make money is a sure way to losing.
